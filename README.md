## About the app

This project is inspired by a mini Thai noodle shop by my aunt, she has problems when taking orders she can't remember all orders, and it takes a lot of time to calculate the total price. Therefore, I will create this web application to solve those problems.

## Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
